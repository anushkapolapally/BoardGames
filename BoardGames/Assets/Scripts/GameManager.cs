I'm thinking of building a collection of 3D games so that the user can
select what game they willl be playing. I will first build dominos.

Dominos start:
- scene of table with the pool of dominos in the center
- 28 tiles total in the boneyard (total set of dominos)
    - 
- Each player draws 7 tiles
